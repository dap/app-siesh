Installation instructions for App::Siesh

To install this module, just do:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install  (this step may need to be done as the superuser)

To run the test suite, please create a configfile t/conf.pl that return
a hash ref with the hostname, the username and password as keys. For
example:

{
	host => 'imap',
	user => 'dom',
	password => 'xxx',
}

If this file does not exist, we just skip all tests that need a network
connection.

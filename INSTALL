Testing App::Siesh

To run the test suite, please create a config file named t/siesh.conf. See
the pod of bin/siesh for possible values.

	host = imap
	user = dom
	password = xxx

If this file does not exist, we just skip all tests that need a network
connection.

ALL SCRIPTS WILL BE DELETED WHEN TESTING SO DO *NOT* USE YOUR NORMAL
